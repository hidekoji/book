## R 1.5.0

Released on 6/16/2016

### New Features

- Chart Sharing and Embedding - Now you can publish charts directly from inside the data frame without creating a note. The hosted chart will have an unique URL and can be shared with the URL or embedded into your web pages or blog (e.g. Wordpress) with the automatically generated code. Also, you can share the chart URL on other mediums like Twitter, Facebook, Slack, etc, and the chart images will be automatically shown up. [Blog post](https://blog.exploratory.io/introducing-interactive-chart-sharing-and-embedding-4cfb801c063e#.7it0wsko0)
- Branch - You can create one or more branches inside the data frame to quickly experiment different analysis paths. All the branches inside a single data frame can share the common data transformation and analysis path in a main branch while they can have their own different analysis paths. Being able to run multiple experiments by creating multiple branches inside the data frames will enhance the flexibility and efficiency of your exploratory data analysis. Data dependency among the branches and among the transformation steps are managed by Exploratory's DAG engine to keep all the data cache intact. [Blog post](https://blog.exploratory.io/introducing-branch-for-running-multiple-experiments-quickly-84352ce245b6#.150aissqr)
- Text Analytics - We have added a set of the text mining related functions that are designed to work better with 'tidy' data form. By employing these functions, you can quickly tokenize text, remove stop words, stem words, construct n-grams, calculate TF-IDF and document similarity, reduce dimensions with SVD, and building document clustering models.
- Added [Short Cut Keys](http://docs.exploratory.io/shortcut.html) for the command input.

### Enhancements

- Chart: Support custom text entry for Title, X-Axis, and Y-Axis.
- Windows: you can now scroll Table view vertically and horizontally by using the scroll bar as well as using touch pad.
- Added %nin% (Not IN) operator so that you can use it in a condition (e.g. filter).

## R 1.4.2

Released on 5/26/2016

### New Features

- Text data wrangling with the tidytext package, which makes it easy to work with text data in a tidy format.

  With this tidytext package introduction, we are introducing unnest_tokens and pair_counts functions from the tidytext package as data frame level functions and get_sentiment and get_stopwords functions from the exploratory package as mutate / filter level functions.

- Introducing 'ip_to_country' function from the rgeolocate package to convert from IP addresses to country names.
- Introducing 'countrycode' function from the countrycode package to map among all the combinations of country names and country codes including ISO2 and ISO3 letters and numbers.
- Introducing 'calc_cor_cat' function from the exploratory package to calculate correlations between all the combinations of category column values based on a tidy data. There is also another function 'calc_cor_var', which calculate correlations between all the combinations of a given set of columns (variables).
- Introducing a new chart type 'Choropleth - Map' which would visualize the data based on either US State names or World country names.


### Enhancements

- Chart: Support continuous values (numeric data type) for Color for Scatterplot chart.

## R 1.4.1

Released on 5/16/2016

### New Features

- Introducing the broom package's tidy / glance / augment functions as data wrangling grammar
- Support 'model' and 'source data' type columns so that you can build models with functions like do_lm, do_glm, do_kmeans, and store them inside the data frame. This makes it possible to call broom's tidy functions to access the models' statistical summary information or augment their scored data with the original data columns.

### Enhancements

- Installer: It checks if Git is installed under /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin. Unless it's older than 2.0 it won't try to install or upgrade. Please check FAQ page for the detail on the version check logic and requirements for both R and Git.
- Installer: It will install required R packages into Exploratory's repository location, instead of into the R's system location.
- Chart: Heatmap / Contour - introducing an option to choose whether NA as NA or zero.
- Chart: You can add margin (space) at X-axis and Y-axis so that text label can be showing up better.
- Improvements for model building and inspection for Linear Regression (lm), K-means clustering (kmeans), and Generalized Linear Regression (glm).
- Table: You can select # of rows to display in the table. The options are 200 (default), 500, 1000.
- Excel Data: It shows a dropdown list so that you can select a sheet name instead of needing to type the name.
